# Checking input number

This code creates a simple web application that receives a number from the user via a prompt window, and based on the entered number, displays a message corresponding to the season of the year.

Using the "switch" statement.

After receiving the number from the user:
1. If the received number is in the range from 1 to 12 inclusive, displayed the alert message  the season of the year to which the number (month number) entered by the user belongs.
2. If the number is not in the range from 1 to 12, then in the message we conclude that it is impossible.
